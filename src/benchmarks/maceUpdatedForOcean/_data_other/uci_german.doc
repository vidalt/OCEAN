Two datasets are provided.  the original dataset, in the form provided
by Prof. Hofmann, contains categorical/symbolic attributes and
is in the file "german.data".

For algorithms that need numerical attributes, Strathclyde University
produced the file "german.data-numeric".  This file has been edited
and several indicator variables added to make it suitable for
algorithms which cannot cope with categorical variables.   Several
attributes that are ordered categorical (such as attribute 17) have
been coded as integer.    This was the form used by StatLog.
